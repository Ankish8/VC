# Facebook Conversions API Testing Guide

## üß™ Test Event Code: `TEST92674`

Your test event code has been configured in `.env` file. All events sent in development will be tagged with this code and appear in the **Test Events** tab in Facebook Events Manager.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Add Your Pixel ID First

Before testing, you **MUST** add your Facebook Pixel ID to the `.env` file:

```bash
# Edit line 38 in .env:
NEXT_PUBLIC_FB_PIXEL_ID="YOUR_PIXEL_ID_HERE"
```

**Without the Pixel ID, events won't be sent to Facebook!**

2. **Make sure all parameters match** what's shown in the payload
3. **Submit the test**
4. **Return to Test Events page** to verify

---

## üìä **Verifying Events in Facebook**

### **Step 1: Open Test Events Tab**

```
1. Go to: https://business.facebook.com/events_manager
2. Click on "Test Events" tab (top navigation)
3. Keep this page open while testing
```

### **Step 2: What to Look For**

  - Action Source: "website"

‚úÖ **Customer Information**:
  - Email (shows as "Matched" when hashed correctly)
  - External ID (shows as "Matched")
  - Client IP Address
  - Client User Agent

---

## üîç **Troubleshooting**

### **Events Not Appearing?**

**Check 1: Pixel ID**
```bash
# Make sure it's set in .env
grep NEXT_PUBLIC_FB_PIXEL_ID .env

# Should NOT be "your-facebook-pixel-id-here"
```

**Check 2: Access Token**
```bash
# Make sure it's set
grep FB_CONVERSION_API_TOKEN .env

# Should be a long string starting with "EAA..."
```

**Check 3: Test Event Code**
```bash
# Make sure it's set
grep FB_TEST_EVENT_CODE .env

# Should be: TEST92674
```

**Check 4: Server Running**
```bash
# Make sure dev server is running
# Should show: ‚úì Ready in XXXms
```

**Check 5: Browser Console**
```
Open DevTools ‚Üí Console
Look for any JavaScript errors
```

**Check 6: Server Logs**
```
Look for:
  ‚úÖ Facebook Conversion Event tracked: [EventName]

Or errors:
  ‚ùå Facebook Conversions API Error: [error message]
```

---

### **Low Event Match Quality?**

If Facebook shows low match quality in Test Events:

**Check these are being sent**:
- ‚úÖ Email (should show as "Matched")
- ‚úÖ External ID (should show as "Matched")
- ‚úÖ Client IP Address (should show as "Matched")
- ‚úÖ Client User Agent (should show as "Matched")
- ‚úÖ fbp cookie (should show as "Matched")
- ‚úÖ fbc cookie (may not always be present)

**If any show as "Not Matched"**:
1. Check server logs to see what data is being sent
2. Verify the data is being hashed correctly (email, external_id)
3. Ensure cookies are being set (check browser DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Cookies)

---

### **Duplicate Events?**

If you see the same event twice:

**This is EXPECTED** for Purchase and Subscribe events:
- One event from server-side API
- One event from browser pixel
- Facebook automatically deduplicates them using `event_id`

**Check deduplication is working**:
- Look at event details in Test Events
- Should show "Deduplicated" or matching event_id

---

## ‚úÖ **Testing Checklist**

Before marking testing complete, verify:

```
‚ñ° Pixel ID added to .env
‚ñ° Access Token added to .env
‚ñ° Test Event Code added to .env (TEST92674)
‚ñ° Dev server restarted after .env changes

## üöÄ **Going to Production**

Once testing is complete and all events are working:

### **Step 1: Remove Test Event Code**

For production, remove or comment out the test event code:

```bash
# In .env file, comment out or remove:
# FB_TEST_EVENT_CODE="TEST92674"
```

Or update your code to only use test code in development.

### **Step 2: Update Pixel ID for Production**

Make sure you're using the correct Pixel ID for your production Facebook account.

### **Step 3: Deploy**

Deploy your code to production and verify events appear in:
- Events Manager ‚Üí **Overview** tab (not Test Events)

### **Step 4: Monitor Event Match Quality**

After 24-48 hours of live data:
1. Check Events Manager ‚Üí Data Quality
2. Target: 8.0+ out of 10 match quality
3. Our implementation should achieve 8.5-9.5
