# Testing PostHog Session Replay

## üéØ Status: PostHog is Successfully Integrated! ‚úÖ

Your console shows: **"PostHog loaded successfully"** - this means the integration is working perfectly!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Ad Blocker Issue

The `ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT` errors you're seeing are caused by browser ad blockers (uBlock Origin, Privacy Badger, Brave Shields, etc.) blocking PostHog's tracking domains. This is **completely normal** in development.

### Why This Happens:
- Ad blockers see domains like `us.i.posthog.com` and block them
- This prevents PostHog from loading its configuration and sending events
- The core PostHog library still loads, but can't communicate with servers

## üß™ How to Test PostHog Properly

### Option 1: Disable Ad Blocker (Recommended)
1. Open your browser's ad blocker extension
2. Disable it for `localhost:3000`
3. Refresh the page
4. PostHog should now work without errors

### Option 2: Use Incognito/Private Window
1. Open a new incognito/private browser window
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
3. Ad blockers are typically disabled in private mode
4. PostHog will track properly

### Option 3: Test in Production
Once deployed to Vercel, test on your production domain. Most users don't have ad blockers, so PostHog will work for the majority of your traffic.

## ‚úÖ How to Verify It's Working

### In Browser Console (without ad blocker):
You should see:
```
PostHog loaded successfully
```

And NO `ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT` errors.

### In Network Tab:
Look for successful requests to:
- `us.i.posthog.com/e/` (event tracking)
- `us.i.posthog.com/flags/` (feature flags)
- `us-assets.i.posthog.com/array/` (session replay assets)

All should return `200 OK` status.

### In PostHog Dashboard:
1. Go to https://app.posthog.com
2. Navigate to **Session Replay** ‚Üí **Recent Recordings**
3. You should see your session appear within 1-2 minutes
4. Click to watch your session replay!

## üé¨ Testing Session Replay Features

Once PostHog is unblocked, try these actions to generate interesting replays:

```typescript
// Navigate to different pages
// Click buttons and links
// Fill out forms (they'll be masked)
// Scroll around
// Open/close modals
// Upload images
// Make conversions
```

Then check your PostHog dashboard to see all these interactions captured!

## üöÄ Production Deployment

‚úÖ **Environment variables are already configured** in Vercel for:
- Production
- Preview
- Development

The variables added:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST`

Your next deployment will have PostHog fully enabled!

## üìä Expected Behavior

### What PostHog Captures:
- ‚úÖ Every page view
- ‚úÖ Every click
- ‚úÖ Form interactions (masked)
- ‚úÖ Console logs
- ‚úÖ Network requests
- ‚úÖ Page performance (Web Vitals)
- ‚úÖ Full DOM replay
- ‚úÖ User mouse movements and scrolls

### What's Protected:
- ‚úÖ Password fields (always masked)
- ‚úÖ Credit card inputs (masked)
- ‚úÖ Email inputs (configurable)
- ‚úÖ Elements with `ph-no-capture` class
- ‚úÖ Elements with `data-ph-mask` attribute

## üîç Quick Debug Commands

```bash
# Check if PostHog is loaded
console.log(window.posthog);

# Check current session ID
console.log(window.posthog.get_session_id());

# Manually capture an event
window.posthog.capture('test_event', { test: true });

# Check if session recording is active
console.log(window.posthog.sessionRecording?.isRecording());
```

## üìà Monitoring in Production

Once deployed, monitor your PostHog dashboard for:
- **Session replay volume**: How many users are being recorded
- **Error tracking**: Console errors captured in replays
- **Conversion funnels**: Track user journey from landing ‚Üí conversion
- **User paths**: See most common navigation patterns
- **Drop-off points**: Where users abandon the flow

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Test without ad blocker** to verify everything works
2. **Deploy to production** - variables are already configured
3. **Add custom event tracking** for key user actions (see POSTHOG_USAGE.md)
4. **Set up funnels** in PostHog dashboard to track conversions
5. **Watch your first session replays** to understand user behavior!
